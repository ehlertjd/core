       >Uploads a list of file fields sent as file1, file2, etc to an existing
        container and updates fields of the files, the container and it's
        parents as specified in the metadata fileformfield using the
        engine placer class

        all files as ``output=true`` using the job-based analyses placer
        class.  See schemas/input/analysis.json
