  post:
    summary: Multipart form upload with N file fields, each with their desired filename.
    description: >
      For technical reasons, no form field names can be repeated. Instead, use
      (file1, file2) and so forth.

      A non-file form field called "metadata" is also required, which must be
      a string containing JSON.

      See api/schemas/input/labelupload.json for the format of this metadata.
